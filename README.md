This is a test automation framework built to validate the core functionalities of an e-commerce website using Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, and Maven.
It covers end-to-end user workflows such as login, product search, add to cart, checkout, and order confirmation.
The goal is to ensure functional stability, cross-browser compatibility, and maintainability of test cases using a modular, annotation-driven structure.
